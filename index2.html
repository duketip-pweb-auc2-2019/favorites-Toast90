                <p>Classic Duff: If they weren't our sponser, we'd be an even bigger dump. Thanks, Duff!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Triple Deep Fried Duff: We deep fried everything, including the bottle, for 24 hours. It's hardly recognizable as beer of any kind.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Gummi Beers: They're gummies. In the shape of beer bottles. Thus, we call them "Gummi Beers".</p>
                <br>
                <p>Pretzels: Oh, wait, those are for me. Sorry about that.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Flaming Moe: Used to be world famous, until some moron let loose the recipe. Nowadays, you can buy it almost anywhere.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Forget Me Shot: Erases the last 24 hours from your mind. Please keep in mind that it does not make other people forget the last 24 hours. Use with caution.</p>
